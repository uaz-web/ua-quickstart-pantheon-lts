# UAQS Core Module

## End of life (2023-11-15)

As of November 15, 2023, UA Quickstart (Quickstart 1) and all of its associated repositories will no longer supported by the Arizona Digital team.  Any website still using Quickstart 1 after the end-of-life date should be migrated to Quickstart 2 as soon as possible.

See the [main UA Quickstart repository](https://bitbucket.org/ua_drupal/ua_quickstart/src/7.x-1.x/README.md) for more information.

## Overview

Provides core dependencies and features for the [UA Quickstart](https://bitbucket.org/ua_drupal/ua_quickstart) Drupal Distribution (or any other distributions wishing to make use of it).

Provides an optional uncached page. This is intended for use with uptime monitoring tools in environments with edge caching. Monitoring the status of a page that is excluded from the cache lets uptime monitoring tools detect downtime that might otherwise be concealed by caching. This functionality can be enabled by setting the uaqs_monitoring_page_enabled variable to TRUE in a site's settings.php file (or via Drush). By default, this page will be at `/uaqs_monitoring_page`. Optionally, this path can be changed by setting the uaqs_monitoring_page_path variable to your preferred path in the site's settings.php file (or via Drush).
