## Views ##

There are two views: a block with a list of 6 events and a full calendar view (responsive and not table-based).

**Note about full calendar view:** By default, the full calendar view is paginating by month. If you do not have *at least* the 7.x-2.9-alpha version of the date module, the calendar will show the wrong date format at the top of the page (see https://www.drupal.org/node/2294973 for full details).

### Structure ###

Included fields:

- Event title (block and page)
- Event date (block and page - several different formats used)
- Event summary (page only)

### Styling ###
To facilitate styling, the view displays have classes added to them via the Views UI.

#### Styling classes are as follows: ####

- **Full Calendar class:** *uaqs-event-calendar*
- **Block class:** *uaqs-event-block-list*
- **Row class:** *uaqs-event-row*
- **Field Classes (block):**
    - Date  *uaqs-event-date*
    - Title  *uaqs-event-title*
- **Field Classes (page):**
    - Date  *uaqs-event-date*
    - Title  *uaqs-event-title*
    - Left Global Text group (contains month and day)  *uaqs-event-left-group*
    - Right Global Text group (contains title, time and summary) *uaqs-event-right-group*
