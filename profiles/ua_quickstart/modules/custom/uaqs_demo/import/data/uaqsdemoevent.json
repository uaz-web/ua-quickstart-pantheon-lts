In the early nineteenth century when Byron wished to portray a magician, he chose a Swiss setting for his Manfred, rather than drawing on anything from his native land. The persecution of witches extending back from the eighteenth through the seventeenth centuries was framed entirely within the accounts of their accusers, not by any independent literary productions. Parallel explorations of astrology and alchemy are best understood in the context of proto-science rather than some independent magical tradition (the much-discussed full collection of Newton's writings being a case in point). In the sixteenth century John Dee has a reasonable claim to be a genuine writer on magic, but this is offset by the tragic arc of his career, from high regard at court to penury and the ridicule of his contemporaries. At around the same time Marlowe turned to the already pan-European legend of Faust for his magician, rather than drawing on anything closer to hand. Figures such as John Damian in the earlier sixteenth century are again best understood as belonging to alchemical proto-science, and in Damian's case his status as a foreigner strengthens the case that there was no insular magical tradition. One has to look several centuries earlier to Michael Scott to find an insular magician famous enough to have acquired a European reputation (Dante consigns him to one of the circles of Hell), and only the entirely legendary Merlin is held in any significant regard.”",

One can look at the towering granite cliffs of Yosemite and suppose that there was a time when oceans of magma existed within the Earth. However geophysical evidence shows that practically everything above the liquid outer core is solid. Even the more fluid aesthenosphere that provides the motility needed for plate tectonics is still a solid in all practical respects, and in highly active areas such as mid-ocean ridges only a small fraction of liquid magma exists at any given time; moreover currently identified magma chambers have many gradations between solid and liquid.\n\nAlthough there have been times of increased volcanic activity in the past (the flood basalts of the Columbia River basin or the Deccan Traps), there is no need to suppose that conditions beneath the earth were significantly different when igneous rocks formed. Deep time provides the correct perspective: the time during which a rock existed as liquid in a magma chamber or lava flow is almost vanishingly small compared to the time it subsequently persisted as a solid. Only the exceptional conditions for one phase of the Earth's earlier history (the postulated Late Heavy Bombardment) would have led to proportionally large volumes of liquified rock.”",

The first indication that breakaway factions in the activist community have embraced this new direction has come from an explosion disrupting logging operations in the Pacific Northwest. Investigation revealed that no bomb had been planted, but that the normal mechanisms of resin formation within the trees themselves had been genetically modified to emplace lenses of high explosive within their bark (giving them the kind of reactive armor used in tanks and other military vehicles). There is a real risk that other species may be weaponized to defend themselves against human interference, and biotechnology research groups at universities are being asked to help identify the dangerous subversives they may be harboring.”",
